= cargo-crate
:toc: right
:prj: pass:q[`cargo-crate`]
:cmd: cargo-crate

== Intro

{prj} is an additional cargo command for your crate. It basiscally does the same (I'd argue better) than the following:

- `cargo-show`
- `cargo-info`
- `cargo-open`
- `cargo-search`

and does not require installing several crates/commands.

== Features

In a nutshell {prj} allows:

- fetching information about one or several crates, including its owners
- opening a crate in crates.io
- opening a crates' documentation directly
- opening a crates' repository directly
- opening a crates' homepage directly

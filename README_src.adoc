:cmd: cargo-crate

== Intro

{prj} is an additional cargo command for your crate(s).

== Features

In a nutshell {prj} allows:

- fetching information about one or several crates, including the owners
- opening crate(s) in crates.io
- opening crates' documentation directly
- opening crates' repository directly
- opening crates' homepage directly
- search for crates passing a pattern

You may pass either the name of your crate such as `cargo-crate` but you may also provide the path of a package or even a workspace.

You may for instance find the following commands rather useful:
- `cargo crate open .`
- `cargo crate open . --doc`
- `cargo crate open . --repo` (if you like that, checkout https://github.com/chevdor/gh[`chevdor/gho`])
- `cargo crate info .`

For all the command above, if you work on a workspace, all its crates will be handled.

== Similar projects

{prg} basiscally does the same (I'd argue better) than the following (combined):
- `cargo-show`
- `cargo-info`
- `cargo-open`
- `cargo-search`

=== Aliases

You will typically use cargo-crate as `cargo crate <command> [args]` which you may find a bit verbose.
To make it easier, `cargo` allows defining aliases in you `$CARGO_HOME/config` file under the `[alias]` section.

You may for instance add:
```
[alias]
...
open = "crate open"
info = "crate info"
show = "crate info"
```

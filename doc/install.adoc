=== Aliases

You will typically use cargo-crate as `cargo crate <command> [args]` which you may find a bit verbose.
To make it easier, `cargo` allows defining aliases in you `$CARGO_HOME/config` file under the `[alias]` section.

You may for instance add:
```
[alias]
...
open = "crate open"
info = "crate info"
show = "crate info"
repo = "crate open --repo"
home = "crate open --home"
docu = "crate open --doc"
```

Those will allow you the following calls:

- `cargo repo clap` opens the clap documentation
- `cargo home clap` opens the clap homepage
- etc...
